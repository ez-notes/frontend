# EZ-Notes

EZ-Notes is an application for saving simple text notes online. 
When you first enter the site, you will be met with a sign-up/login page that will require the user authenticate and authorize themselves. Once logged in, the user will be routed to the 'notes' page, where they can add a new note, or view an existing note. When the user clicks to view their note, they can click on the edit button to open a modal editor for the note, or click on the delete to remove the note.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
The front-end of the application is built in React, react-bootstrap, framer/motion, and Auth0, and is attached to a backend application built using Express, Mongoose, MongoDB and Node.js. The backend is deployed on Heroku and the frontend is deployed on Netlify.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
All you need to work EZ-Notes is a modern web browser and you're good to go!

## MVP USER STORIES
- _As a user, I want to be able to create and sign into an account._
- _As a user, I want to be able to create notes, view notes that I've added to the site, and delete them._

## WIREFRAMES
These were the concepts for the site I created in Google Slides.

## APPROACH TAKEN
I started off with a plan, a simple note-pad that had my CRUD defined as creating notes, populating them on the page, individually updating them and deleting them. I listed the processes I'd need to follow, creating a Github organization for the project, two repos, creating and cleaning up a React app, creating the backend and then creating components and building the front end, and lastly styling.

I had a project per day. After setting up what would be in the project, I began with my backend, defining basic CRUD models, and files for testing its functionality in Postman. Getting the backend deployed onto Heroku turned out to be a challenge, ultimately the bug was resolved, and the front end could begin.

I built the application with a barebones skeleton, but as puzzles revealed themselves, I did my best to break down each challenge into separate components, and tried to keep those components organized into their own directories. So I ended up with a directory for the application, the components, within the components the new visitor screen, the user login/signup, the loading screen, each have their own directories and subdirectories therin, just to keep each problem/solution isolated and organized.

I used Bootstrap to style the project while it was in progress, but found that bootstrap's stylings are a little basic, and so besides the card elements, all bootstrap was removed and either hand-styled in CSS or uses motion elements from framer/motion. 

There are still some functions that I'd like to revisit to imporve functionality under the hood, but as these didn't affect MVP, I chose to leave them to further iterations, and leave future works to the sudowoodo file, where I kept my pseudocode throughout the project.

## THE FUTURE ON EZ-Notes

When I come back, I plan to break the Stats component down further, continue to dry-up my code, and add more coments. There's some data that I didn't get to put on the page because I have to learn more about navigating the API, but that's a stretch goal as I return an tweak the app.
