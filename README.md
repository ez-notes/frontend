# EZ-Notes

EZ-Notes is an application for saving simple text notes online. 
When you first enter the site, you will be met with a sign-up/login page that will require the user authenticate and authorize themselves. Once logged in, the user will be routed to the 'notes' page, where they can add a new note, or view an existing note. When the user clicks to view their note, they can click on the edit button to open a modal editor for the note, or click on the delete to remove the note.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
The front-end of the application is built in React, react-bootstrap, framer/motion, and Auth0, and is attached to a backend application built using Express, Mongoose, MongoDB and Node.js. The backend is deployed on Railway and the frontend is deployed on Netlify.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
All you need to work EZ-Notes is a modern web browser and you're good to go!

## MVP USER STORIES
- _As a user, I want to be able to create and sign into an account._
- _As a user, I want to be able to create notes, view notes that I've added to the site, and delete them._

## WIREFRAMES
These were the concepts for the site I created in Google Slides.

## THE FUTURE ON EZ-Notes

There are still some functions that I'd like to revisit to imporve functionality under the hood, but as these didn't affect MVP, I chose to leave them to further iterations, and leave future works to the sudowoodo file, where I kept my pseudocode throughout the project.
