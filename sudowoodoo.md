This is my pseudocode.

Make a "Create Notes" button to reach full CRUD

Then, make Users function (Fuck Auth for now)

A sign in for the user

A login page for the user

Notes have to load the ones that are owned by the user and only the user.

Notes need to not load if the current user is not logged in.

Tackle Auth.
